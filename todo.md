# PDF-Notes Plugin Rebuild - Todo Log

## Project Overview
Complete rebuild of PDF-Notes plugin from scratch, ignoring corrupted previous versions.
Target: Create a full-featured PDF viewer with integrated Obsidian note-taking.

## Comprehensive Rebuild Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture (v1.0.1)
- [ ] Clean slate approach: Start fresh, ignoring corrupted previous versions
- [ ] Plugin structure: Main plugin class, PDF view class, settings system
- [ ] File naming: Rename to "PDF-Notes" as specified
- [ ] Right-click integration: Add context menu for PDFs in vault

### Phase 2: PDF & Note Integration (v1.0.2-1.0.3)  
- [ ] Side-by-side layout: PDF viewer alongside full Obsidian note editor
- [ ] Per-page notes: Each PDF page gets its own note section
- [ ] Full Obsidian integration: Notes have complete access to plugins/shortcuts
- [ ] Note linking: Single note file with internal links to each page section

### Phase 3: File Management (v1.0.4-1.0.5)
- [ ] Auto-naming: Save as `<name>_annotated.pdf` and `<name>_notes.md`
- [ ] File association: Annotated PDFs always open with PDF-Notes extension
- [ ] Auto-save: Save on close/focus change to current folder
- [ ] Linked reopening: Notes and PDFs easily open together

### Phase 4: Layout Controls (v1.0.6-1.0.7)
- [ ] Flexible layouts: Split left/right/top/bottom options
- [ ] Show/hide toggles: Independent visibility for PDF and notes panels
- [ ] Resizable windows: Draggable divider between panels
- [ ] PDF zoom controls: Auto-fit width/height, manual zoom in/out

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (v1.0.8-1.0.9)
- [ ] PDF highlighting: Select text to highlight with color options
- [ ] Highlight linking: Connect highlights to specific note sections
- [ ] Annotation persistence: Highlights saved in annotated PDF
- [ ] Enhanced UI: Polish, keyboard shortcuts, improved UX

## Technical Implementation Requirements
- **PDF.js integration**: Proper worker setup for PDF rendering
- **Obsidian Editor API**: Full integration for note editing capabilities
- **File system operations**: Handle PDF copying, note creation/linking
- **Event handling**: Auto-save triggers, layout changes, highlight interactions
- **CSS styling**: Responsive layouts, theme compatibility

## Version Progression: 1.0.1 → 1.0.9
Each version builds incrementally on the previous, with comprehensive testing and logging.
