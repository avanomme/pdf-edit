Alright, let’s get real and lay out how to get your precious Obsidian add-on into the Community Plugins treasure trove—without sugarcoating or robotic fluff.

⸻

1. Build and Release Your Plugin Like a Boss
	1.	Develop your plugin using the sample plugin template. Make sure you’ve got your main.js, manifest.json, and optional styles.css, plus a README.md with usage instructions and a LICENSE file.
￼
	2.	Version it properly: update manifest.json, and optionally versions.json if you want backward compatibility.
	3.	Release on GitHub using the exact version number as the tag (no v prefix). Attach the files (manifest.json, main.js, styles.css) directly to the release.

2. Submit It to the Official Plugin Store
	1.	Fork the obsidian-releases repo on GitHub.
	2.	Edit community-plugins.json—append your plugin info to the end of the list:
	•	id: must match what’s in your manifest.json
	•	name
	•	author
	•	description
	•	repo: e.g., your-username/your-plugin-repo
￼
	3.	Open a Pull Request (PR). Use GitHub’s preview submission checklist to ensure you’ve ticked all required boxes.
￼ ￼
	4.	Sit tight. If your PR has merge conflicts, don’t panic—maintainers will sort it out.
￼ ￼

That’s pretty much the standard workflow. Once your PR is merged, users can install your plugin via the Community Plugins browser inside Obsidian.

Reddit Chatter for Real-World Perspective

Here’s what the crowd’s saying in the wild Obsidian subreddit:

“Don’t just testify that you followed the plugin guidelines… most don’t even read them”—so actually follow them. The sentence case rule is often flubbed.
￼

When adding your plugin to community-plugins.json, “fork the repo, add your own entry to the end of the list, and create a pull request… you don’t need to care about merge conflicts, they handle them themselves.”

TL;DR Cheat Sheet

Step	What You Do
1. Prep Plugin	Make code, manifest.json, README.md, release on GitHub
2. Create Release	Tag version (no v), upload files
3. Update JSON List	Add to community-plugins.json with matching id and metadata
4. Open PR	Provide clear info, complete checklist, submit to obsidian-releases
5. Wait for Review	Maintainers will either merge or request corrections

Final Thought: Shoot Your Shot

If you’re weighing risk, Obsidian’s plugin process includes an initial review—but stays hands-off afterward. As one user put it:

“For a plugin to be included … it needs to be open source, and there is a plugin review process… Changes made with updates are not checked.”
￼

So keep your code clean, tests tight, and docs clear—and you’ll get in. It’s like submitting your nerd baby to Hogwarts; messy spells might get owl-trashed, neat ones get a letter.
