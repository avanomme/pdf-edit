This is an obsidian plugin. It allows the user to open any pdf and create notes per pedf page. The pdf and notes can be arranged with either split left or right of the other or top or bottom, the pdf must be zoomable but the original fit should be widht. The notes must then link to the pdf and all be saved as a single note so as not to clutter up the vault. alot has been implemented but there are still errors
